New pkgdown_sitrep() function reporting whether pkgdown website URL stored pkgdown configuration DESCRIPTION. (#1478) pkgdown (concert downlit roxygen2) moving towards consistent HTML structure syntax highlighting. goal always <div> class sourceCode (classes needed), contains one <pre>s class sourceCode language, <pre> contains <code>. Something like : Long lines code output now wrapped, rather requiring scrolling. better matches rmarkdown::html_document() see console. Use autolink_bare_uris Pandoc version 2.0 (@marcosmolla, #1618). pkgdown now supports defining redirects. (#1259, @lorenzwalthert). syntax following, old paths left, new paths URLs right. build_news() longer breaks URLs numeric fragments (@krassowski, #1456). 404 page (default .github/404.md) longer built development mode (see ?build_site) e.g. GitHub pages uses 404.html page root, say, 404 page built unreleased release modes. (#1622) links 404 pages (navbar, scripts, CSS) now absolute URL configuration file. (#1622) Heading links/IDs changelog now permanent except links corresponding development version. built combination heading slug package version number. (@Bisaloo, #1015) pkgdown’s deploy_to_branch() now cleans website directory default (clean = TRUE). revert previous behaviour, call clean = FALSE. (#1394) pkgdown now supports local searching. enabled default set-needed users search pkgdown websites. (#1629, help @gustavdelius #1655) pkgdown builds exhaustive sitemap.xml even websites built Bootstrap 3. might change Algolia results use Algolia search. (#1629) Styling errors, warnings, messages tweaked. Messages now displayed way output, warnings errors bolded, coloured. part suite changes allow package authors greater control message/warning/error appearance. Autolinking longer failures package contains duplicated Rd aliases. pkgdown websites using BS4 accessible, besides better color contrast: heading anchors now property aria-hidden reduce noise screenreader users. aria-labelledby property navbar dropdowns fixed. default GitHub/GitLab links gained aria-label; use aria-labels icons encouraged docs. (#1635) README badges single paragraph, placed badges: end badges: end comments, detected (#1603). Automatic links reference pages generated incorrectly, self-links generated, \\name{} entry *.Rd file didn’t match filename (@dmurdoch, #1586; #1676). New “Customize pkgdown website” vignette (#1573). Added extension points make HTML widgets (RGL particular) work rendered examples (@dmurdoch). Allow template packages provide default configuration _pkgdown.yml, stored inst/pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml. can used set (e.g.) author definitions, Bootstrap version variables, sidebar, footer, navbar, etc. Configuration parameters supplied template package lowest priority overridden local _pkgdown.yml turn overridden override parameter build_site(). (#1499) pkgdown now contains templates using Bootstrap 4 (help @jayhesselberth). Biggest differences Bootstrap 3 templates assets: bigger default font size; darker links; active item tables contents highlighted grey background bold font instead left border; changelog release date sub-title version name; present logo appear pages near header (cf usethis::use_logo() using logo file package). Easy customisation colours fonts bslib Thoughtful typography make contents easy possible read, regardless size device. R syntax highlighting autolinking downlit now paired accessible colour scheme designed Alison Hill.

Authors configuration flexible. Users can now: Choose roles used filtering authors sidebar footer. Choose text authors footer. Add text authors list sidebar. Add text authors list authors page. (#1516) Make authors’ non-ORCID comments DESCRIPTION usable bio/description contributions: add link authors page sidebar author non-ORCID comment, render non-ORCID comments authors page. (#1516) Better handling mix citations without text version. Also escapes HTML text version (@bastistician, #1507). Make links 404’s navbar absolute (#1524). Make navbar specification flexible: now possible include default components navbar structure. (#1517) Make footer specification flexible: users can now change placement elements left right add text left right (even remove/replace default text) (#1502) pkgdown now recognizes GitLab URLs source repository adds corresponding icon navbar (#1493). External links now get class “external-link” top usual classes, . Therefore can targeted easily CSS rules. (#881, #1491) pkgdown can now use templates “-header.html”/“-head.html”, “-body.html” “-body.html” whose content placed (similarly bookdown options in_header, before_body after_body), respectively, end <head> tag; right opening <body> tag; closing tag <\/body> (#1487).

Make sidebar specification flexible: users can now change order sidebar elements add custom sidebar sections (title, text can Markdown HTML) add table contents README completely suppress sidebar (even “Dev status”) provide HTML navbar.
