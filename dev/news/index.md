# Changelog

## pkgdown (development version)

- `autolink_html()` deprecated in 1.6.0 and `preview_page()` have been
  removed.
- New translations were add for Dutch (`nl`) and Japanese (`ja`), thanks
  to [@pepijn-devires](https://github.com/pepijn-devires) and
  [@shikokuchuo](https://github.com/shikokuchuo) respectively.
- New
  [`build_llm_docs()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_llm_docs.md)
  generates a `llms.txt` at the root directory of your site, and
  provides a `.md` version of every page. You can disable by adding
  `llm-docs: false` to your `_pkgdown.yaml`
  ([\#2914](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2914),
  [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle))
- Links generated with `\code{\link{foo}()}` now have the `()` moved
  into the `<a>` in the generated output
  ([@maelle](https://github.com/maelle)).
- Plots in dark mode are now transformed with a CSS filter to improve
  their visibility (thanks to
  [@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie)).
- Updated the translations vignette with instructions for building
  non-English sites through Github Actions.
- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  gained a `quiet` argument, which is propagated to other functions
  (e.g.,
  [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md))
  and is useful for debugging build errors on GH actions.
- Added documentation explaining how to solve incorrect rendering of
  plotmath expressions under ragg devices on Linux.
  ([@remlapmot](https://github.com/remlapmot),
  [\#2908](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2908))
- Improved the LaTeX syntax in one of the math rendering test cases
  ([@remlapmot](https://github.com/remlapmot))

## pkgdown 2.1.3

CRAN release: 2025-05-24

- Menu items can now set `class` and `id`.

## pkgdown 2.1.2

CRAN release: 2025-04-28

### New features

- ROR IDs in `DESCRIPTION` are transformed into icons, similar to ORCID
  IDs. ([\#2850](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2850))
- New `clean_site(force = TRUE)` for cleaning of `docs/` regardless of
  whether it was built by pkgdown
  ([\#2827](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2827)).
- The language of the site is set from the first `Language:` in the
  `DESCRIPTION` if it is available and no other language is specified
  ([@jonthegeek](https://github.com/jonthegeek),
  [\#2808](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2808)).

### Bug fixes and minor improvements

- Option `pkgdown.internet` was removed because CDN file caching now
  requires an internet connection.
- Math rendering using katex and mathjax was improved and now includes
  necessary components using CDN
  ([\#2704](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2704)).
- Articles have improved test cases (thanks to
  [@venpopov](https://github.com/venpopov) and
  [@ethanbass](https://github.com/ethanbass)).
- Sass variables from bslib are now used to set the navbar background
  color: `$navbar-bg` for the background color in light and dark mode,
  or `$navbar-light-bg` and `$navbar-dark-bg` for individually
  controlling light and dark mode background colors. `pkgdown-navbar-bg`
  and `$pkgdown-navbar-bg-dark` both still provide pkgdown-specific
  overrides ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#2847](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2847)).
- Code repositories hosted on Codeberg are now supported in the
  `BugReports` and `URL` fields
  ([@nfrerebeau](https://github.com/nfrerebeau),
  [\#2843](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2843)).
- Links to favicons in page headers were updated to reflect changes to
  <https://realfavicongenerator.net/>
  ([\#2804](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2804)). Favicons
  should be re-generated by manually removing the `pkgdown/favicon`
  directory and then running
  [`pkgdown::build_favicons()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_favicons.md).
- Reinstate Rd macro loading, which was accidentally disabled in v2.1.1
  ([\#2782](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2782)).

## pkgdown 2.1.1

CRAN release: 2024-09-17

- Added keyboard shortcut, `/`, to focus search bar
  ([\#2423](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2423)).
- The `BugReports` field can now be an email
  ([@catalamarti](https://github.com/catalamarti),
  [\#2275](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2275)).
- New
  [`clean_cache()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/clean.md)
  function removes the contents of the cache directory
  ([\#2718](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2718)).
- pkgdown now depends on R \>= 4.0.0
  ([\#2714](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2714)).
- Updated GitHub Actions advice and workflows around Quarto install
  ([@tanho63](https://github.com/tanho63),
  [\#2743](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2743)).
- Support ANSI sequences in `index.md`
  ([@krlmlr](https://github.com/krlmlr),
  [\#2787](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2787)).

## pkgdown 2.1.0

CRAN release: 2024-07-06

### Major changes

- Added [@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy) and
  [@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b) as pkgdown authors in
  recognition of their contributions.
- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  and
  [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now support articles/vignettes written with quarto (version 1.5 and
  above). Combining the disparate quarto and pkgdown templating systems
  is a delicate art, so while I’ve done my best to make it work, there
  may be some rough edges. So please file an issue you encounter quarto
  features that don’t work quite right. Learn more in
  [`vignette("quarto")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/quarto.md)([\#2210](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2210)).
- New light switch makes it easy for users to switch between light and
  dark themes for the website (based on work in bslib by
  [@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie)). For now this behaviour is
  opt-in with `template.light-switch: true` but in the future we may
  turn it on automatically. See the customization vignette for details
  ([\#1696](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1696)).
- New
  [`vignette("translations")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/translations.md)
  that discusses non-English sites including how to submit new
  translations ([\#2605](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2605)).
- New
  [`vignette("accessibility")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/accessibility.md)
  describes what manual tasks you need to perform to make your site as
  accessible as possible
  ([\#2344](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2344)).
- New `template.math-rendering` allows you to control how math is
  rendered across your site. The default uses `mathml` which is
  low-dependency, but has the lowest fidelity. You can also use
  `mathjax`, the previous default, and `katex`, a faster alternative.
  ([\#1966](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1966)).
- All external assets (JS, CSS, fonts) are now directly included in the
  site instead of fetched from external CDN
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#2249](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2249))
- YAML validation has been substantially improved so you should get much
  clearer errors if you have made a mistake
  ([\#1927](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1927)). Please file
  an issue if you find a case where the error message is not helpful.

### Lifecycle changes

- `autolink_html()` was deprecated in pkgdown 1.6.0 and now warns every
  time you use it.
  [`downlit::downlit_html_path()`](https://downlit.r-lib.org/reference/downlit_html_path.html)
  should be used instead.
- `build_site(document)` and `build_reference(document)` has been
  removed after being deprecated in pkgdown 1.4.0. `devel` should be
  used instead.
- `preview_page()` has been deprecated
  ([\#2650](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2650)).
- Bootstrap 3 has been deprecated. It was superseded in December 2021,
  and now we’re starting to more directly encourage folks to move away
  from it.

### Front end changes

- When built on GitHub, source urls now use the name of the current
  upstream branch (rather than `HEAD`), which is more likely to generate
  correct links
  ([\#2597](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2597)).
- The search dropdown has been tweaked to look more like the other
  navbar menu items
  ([\#2338](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2338)).
- Improve HTML5 compliance
  ([\#2369](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2369)):
  - No longer support IE9 or earlier
  - Strip trailing whitespace
  - Label `<nav>`s and improve navbar html.
- Tweaked navbar display on mobile so that long titles in drop downs
  (e.g. article titles) are now wrapped, and the search input spans the
  full width ([\#2512](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2512)).
- The title for the “Reference” page is now “Package index” since this
  page might contain more than just function details
  ([\#2181](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2181)).
- Very wide words are now automatically broken across lines and
  hyphenated (when possible) when they’d otherwise create a horizontal
  scrollbar on mobile
  ([\#1888](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1888)).
- The mobile version of pkgdown sites no longer has a scrollburglar (a
  small amount of horizontal scroll)
  ([\#2179](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2179),
  [@netique](https://github.com/netique)).
- Anchors are displayed when they’re the target of a link.
- New translation for “Search site”, the label applied to the search box
  for screenreaders. This was previously incorrectly labelled as “Toggle
  navigation” ([\#2320](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2320)).
- pkgdown no longer overrides the default selection colours. This
  improves accessibility for users who have set their own colours in
  their browser settings
  ([\#2139](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2139),
  [@glin](https://github.com/glin)).
- If you put a dropdown menu (e.g. articles) on the right hand side of
  the navbar, it will now be right aligned. This makes longer titles
  more likely to stay on the page
  ([\#2421](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2421)).
- BS5 templates no longer include empty link to logo when none exists
  ([\#2536](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2536)).
- Updated translations from
  [@jplecavalier](https://github.com/jplecavalier),
  [@dieghernan](https://github.com/dieghernan),
  [@krlmlr](https://github.com/krlmlr),
  [@LDalby](https://github.com/LDalby),
  [@rich-iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone),
  [@jmaspons](https://github.com/jmaspons), and
  [@mine-cetinkaya-rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel)
  ([\#2659](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2659)).

### `_pkgdown.yaml`

- Anywhere you can use `_pkgdown.yml`, you can now use `_pkgdown.yaml`
  ([\#2244](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2244)).
- Custom navbars that specify `icon` but not `aria-label` will now
  generate a message reminding you to provide one for to improve
  accessibility
  ([\#2533](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2533)).
- The `repo.source.url` field no longer requires a trailing slash
  ([\#2017](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2017)).
- The `template.bslib` item now also accepts a `bootswatch` key
  ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#2483](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2483)).
- You can now choose where the search box is placed with the “search”
  navbar component. This has been documented for a very long time, but
  as far as I can tell, never worked
  ([\#2320](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2320)). If you have
  made your own template with a custom `navbar`, you will need to remove
  the `<form>` with `role="search"` to avoid getting two search boxes.

### Minor improvements and bug fixes

- pkgdown now uses httr2 instead of httr
  ([\#2600](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2600)).

- Mathjax now uses version 3.2.2.

- The addin now runs
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  instead of `build_site_external()`, which generally should be more
  reliable ([\#2252](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2252)).

- `<source>` tags now have their `srcref` attributes tweaked in the same
  way that the `src` attributes of `<img>` tags are
  ([\#2402](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2402)).

- `as.pkgdown()` will no longer prompt you to install a missing template
  package from CRAN, since these are almost always found in GitHub
  ([\#2076](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2076)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now recognises a new `external-articles` top-level field that allows
  you to define articles that live in other packages
  ([\#2028](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2028)).

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  no longer has a `data` argument. This is technically a breaking
  change, but I can’t figure out why anyone would have ever used it.

- `build_*()` (apart from
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md))
  functions no longer default to previewing in interactive sessions
  since they now all emit specific links to newly generated files.

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now translates the “Abstract” title if it’s used.

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now escapes html characters in the title
  ([\#2286](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2286)).

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  no longer generates the wrong source link when you build your site
  outside of the root directory
  ([\#2172](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2172)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now reports if you are missing alt-text for any images
  ([\#2357](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2357)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now drops a section called “internal”. This allows you to have
  articles that either aren’t indexed at all or are included manually
  elsewhere in the navbar
  ([\#2205](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2205)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now correctly escapes special HTML characters in the bibtex citation
  ([\#2022](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2022)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer checks if the README is missing any images. This check is
  now performed in
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md),
  after
  [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  so you can refer to images created by vignettes with warnings
  ([\#2194](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2194)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now includes the contents of `inst/AUTHORS` on the authors page
  ([\#2506](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2506)).

- [`build_home_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now reports when rendering the home page
  ([\#2544](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2544)).

- [`build_home_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now renders math if you use it in your home page
  ([\#2263](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2263)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  now works if your package has been archived at some point
  ([\#2687](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2687)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  only syntax highlights the page once, not twice, which prevents every
  block of R code getting a blank line at the start
  ([\#2630](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2630)).

  ``` r
  1 + 1
  ```

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  no longer displays `\dontshow{}` or `\testonly{}` blocks in examples.
  It will run the code in `\dontshow{}`; it won’t run the code in
  `\testonly{}`([\#2188](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2188)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  does a better job of parsing `\value{}` blocks
  ([\#2371](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2371)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now generates the usage that users actually type for infix and
  replacement methods
  ([\#2303](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2303)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now automatically translates `--`, `---`, ``` `` ```, and `''` to
  their unicode equivalents
  ([\#2530](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2530)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now supports `\Sexpr[results=verbatim]`
  ([@bastistician](https://github.com/bastistician),
  [\#2510](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2510)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  adds anchors to arguments making it possible to link directly to an
  argument, if desired. A subtle visual treatment makes it easy to see
  which argument is targeted
  ([\#2228](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2228)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now automatically renders any tables created by gt
  ([\#2326](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2326)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  matches usage for S3 and S4 methods to the style used by R 4.0.0 and
  later ([\#2187](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2187)).

- [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now displays function lifecycle badges next to the function name
  ([\#2123](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2123)). The badges
  are extracted only from the function description. You can now also use
  `has_lifecycle()` to select functions by their lifecycle status.

- [`build_redirects()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_redirects.md)
  is now exported to make it easier to document
  ([\#2500](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2500)).

- [`build_redirects()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_redirects.md)
  now automatically adds redirects for topic aliases. This matches the
  behaviour of `?` and will help keep links stable in the long term
  ([\#1876](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1876)).

- [`build_redirects()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_redirects.md)
  now reports which redirects it is generating.

- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  automatically runs
  [`pkgdown_sitrep()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  at the start of the process
  ([\#2380](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2380)).

- `build_sitemap()` no longer includes redirected pages
  ([\#2582](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2582)).

- [`check_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  and
  [`pkgdown_sitrep()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  have been unified so that they both report on the same problems. They
  now only differ in the style of their output:
  [`pkgdown_sitrep()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  reports whether each category is ok or not ok, while
  [`check_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  errors on the first issue
  ([\#2463](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2463)).

- [`init_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/init_site.md)
  will no longer automatically build favicons on CI systems (e.g. GHA).
  This is an expensive operation that uses an external service so it
  should only be run locally
  ([\#2553](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2553)).

- [`init_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/init_site.md)
  once again describes one copy per line, and now uses a better prefix
  when copying assets from pkgdown itself
  ([\#2445](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2445)).

- [`pkgdown_sitrep()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)/[`check_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  now check that you have up-to-date favicons if you have a package
  logo.

- [`template_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/templates.md)
  and `template_article()` now only add backticks to function names if
  needed ([\#2561](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2561)).

- `vignette("search")` has been removed since BS3 is deprecated and all
  the BS5 docs are also included in
  [`build_search()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_search.md)
  ([\#2564](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2564)).

## pkgdown 2.0.9

CRAN release: 2024-04-18

- Fixes for regressions in 2.0.8:

  - Output links generated when building the site work once again
    ([\#2435](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2435)).

  - pkgdown once again uses Bootstrap version specified in a template
    package ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
    [\#2443](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2443)).

- Front-end improvements:

  - The skip link now becomes visible when focussed
    ([\#2138](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2138)). Thanks to
    [@glin](https://github.com/glin) for the styles!

  - The left and right footers no longer contain an extra empty
    paragraph tag and the footer gains additional padding-top to keep
    the whitespace constant
    ([\#2381](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2381)).

  - Clipboard buttons report their action again (“Copied!”)
    ([\#2462](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2462))

- It is now easier to preview parts of the website locally
  interactively.
  [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  and friends will call
  [`init_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/init_site.md)
  automatically instead of erroring
  ([@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy),
  [\#2329](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2329)).

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  gains a new `new_process` argument which allows to build a vignette in
  the current process for debugging purposes. We’ve also improved the
  error messages and tracebacks if an article fails to build, hopefully
  also making debugging easier
  ([\#2438](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2438)).

- `build_article_index()` and
  [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  use an improved BS5 template that correctly wraps each section
  description in a `<div>`, rather than a `<p>`. This eliminates an
  empty pargraph tag that preceded each section description
  ([\#2352](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2352)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer errors when you have an empty `.md` file
  ([\#2309](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2309)). It alos no
  longer renders Github issue and pull request templates
  ([@hsloot](https://github.com/hsloot),
  [\#2362](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2362))

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  now warns if it doesn’t find any version headings, suggesting that
  that `NEWS.md` is structured incorrectly
  ([\#2213](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2213)).

- `build_readme()` now correctly tweaks links to markdown files that use
  an anchor, e.g. `foo.md#heading-name`
  ([\#2313](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2313)).

- [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  gives more informative errors if your `contents` field is malformed
  ([\#2323](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2323)).

- [`check_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  no longer errors if your intro vignette is an article is not listed in
  `_pkgdown.yml` ([@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy)
  [\#2150](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2150)).

- [`data_template()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/render_page.md)
  gives a more informative error if you’ve misspecified the navbar
  ([\#2312](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2312)).

## pkgdown 2.0.8

CRAN release: 2024-04-10

- pkgdown is now compatible with (and requires) bslib \>= 0.5.1
  ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#2395](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2395)), including a
  fix to BS5 navbar template to get `navbar.type: dark` to work with
  Bootstrap 5.3+ ([@tanho63](https://github.com/tanho63),
  [\#2388](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2388))

- Now uses [cli](https://github.com/r-lib/cli) to provide interactive
  feedback.

- Avoid unwanted linebreaks from parsing `DESCRIPTION`
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#2247](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2247)).

- Translations

  - New Catalan translation ([@jmaspons](https://github.com/jmaspons),
    [\#2333](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2333)).
  - Citation sections are correctly translated
    ([@eliocamp](https://github.com/eliocamp),
    [\#2410](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2410)).

- `build_article_index()` now sorts vignettes and non-vignette articles
  alphabetically by their filename (literally, their
  [`basename()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/basename.html)), by default
  ([@jennybc](https://github.com/jennybc),
  [\#2253](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2253)).

- Deprecated `build_favicon()` was removed
  ([`build_favicons()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_favicons.md)
  remains).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now sets RNG seed by default. Use `build_articles(seed = NULL)` for
  the old (unreproducible) behaviour.
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#2354](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2354)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  will process `.qmd` articles with the quarto vignette builder
  ([@rcannood](https://github.com/rcannood),
  [\#2404](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2404)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  and
  [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now set RNG seed for htmlwidgets IDs. This reduces noise in final HTML
  output, both for articles and examples that contain htmlwidgets
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#2294](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2294),
  [\#2354](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2354)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  correctly parses of github profiles and issues into links when present
  at the beginning of list items
  ([@pearsonca](https://github.com/pearsonca),
  [\#2122](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2122))

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  sets `seed` correctly; it was previously reset too early
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#2355](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2355))

- Rd -\> html translation

  - `\cr` is now translated to `<br>` not `<br />`
    ([\#2400](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2400)).
  - Correct usage for S3 methods with non-syntactic class names
    ([\#2384](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2384)).
  - Preserve Markdown code blocks with class rmd from roxygen2 docs
    ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
    [\#2298](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2298)).

- [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  no longer generates redundant entries when multiple explicit `@usage`
  tags are provided ([@klmr](https://github.com/klmr),
  [\#2302](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2302))

- [`build_reference_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  correctly handles topic names that conflict with selector functions
  ([@dmurdoch](https://github.com/dmurdoch),
  [\#2397](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2397)).

## pkgdown 2.0.7

CRAN release: 2022-12-14

- Fix topic match selection when there is an unmatched selection
  followed by a matched selection
  ([@bundfussr](https://github.com/bundfussr),
  [\#2234](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2234))
- Fix highlighting of nested not R code blocks (for instance, example of
  R Markdown code with chunks)
  ([@idavydov](https://github.com/idavydov),
  [\#2237](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2237)).
- Tweak German translation ([@krlmlr](https://github.com/krlmlr),
  [@mgirlich](https://github.com/mgirlich),
  [@lhdjung](https://github.com/lhdjung),
  [\#2149](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2149),
  [\#2236](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2236))
- Remove mention of (defunct) Twitter card validator, provide
  alternatives ([@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo),
  [\#2185](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2185))
- Fix `keywords` typo in `check_missing_topics()` message
  ([@swsoyee](https://github.com/swsoyee),
  [\#2178](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2178)).
- Use jsdeliver CDN for bootstrap-toc
  ([@GregorDeCillia](https://github.com/GregorDeCillia),
  [\#2207](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2207)).

## pkgdown 2.0.6

CRAN release: 2022-07-16

- If you’re using an RStudio daily, output file names are now clickable,
  previewing the generated HTML in the browser
  ([\#2157](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2157)).

- Getting started vignette no longer needs to be included in the
  articles index
  ([\#2150](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2150)).

- If there aren’t any functions in the `\usage{}` block, then pkgdown
  will now shows all aliases on the reference index, rather than just
  the topic name
  ([\#1624](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1624)).

## pkgdown 2.0.5

CRAN release: 2022-06-23

- Correctly generate downlit link targets for topics that have a file
  name ending in `.`
  ([\#2128](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2128)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md):
  if build fails because the index doesn’t include all articles, you’re
  now told what articles are missing
  ([@zkamvar](https://github.com/zkamvar),
  [\#2121](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2121)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now escapes angle brackets in author
  comments([\#2127](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2127)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  will automatically render and link `.github/SUPPORT.md`
  ([@IndrajeetPatil](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil),
  [\#2124](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2124)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  once again fails to link `@username` at start of bullet. I had to
  reverted [\#2030](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2030)
  because of [\#2122](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2122).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md):
  restore accidentally nerfed `has_keyword()` and `has_concept()`
  reference selectors
  ([\#2126](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2126)) and add
  tests.

## pkgdown 2.0.4

CRAN release: 2022-06-10

- New
  [`check_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  provides a lightweight way to check that your `_pkgdown.yml` is valid
  without building the site
  ([\#2056](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2056)). Invalid
  `_pkgdown.yml` now consistently generates errors both locally and on
  CI ([\#2055](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2055)).

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now supports inline markdown in the `title`
  ([\#2039](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2039)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer shows development status badges on the released version of
  the site ([\#2054](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2054)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  support automated `@username` links in more places
  ([\#2030](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2030)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md):

  - You can once again exclude topics from the reference index with `-`
    ([\#2040](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2040)).

  - Inline markdown in `title`s and `subtitle`s is now
    supported([\#2039](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2039)).

  - Package logos will be automatically stripped from the `.Rd` you
    don’t end up with two on one page.
    ([\#2083](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2083)).

  - `\figure{file}{alternative text}` with multiline alt text is now
    parsed correctly
    ([\#2080](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2080))

  - roxygen 7.2.0 output for generic code blocks
    ([\#2092](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2092),
    [@jabenninghoff](https://github.com/jabenninghoff)) is processed
    correctly.

- Front end changes:

  - Automatically added links in code blocks are now styled less
    aggressively, so they occupy less visual weight on the page
    ([\#2007](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2007)).

  - All article pages are given class `col-md-9` for consistency with
    other pages
    ([\#2045](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2045)).

  - Fixed width HTML widgets are sized correctly
    ([@dmurdoch](https://github.com/dmurdoch),
    [\#2062](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2062)).

  - Footnotes work with more contents, including code
    ([@banfai](https://github.com/banfai),
    [\#2042](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2042)).

  - Navbar components now accept `target` argument
    ([\#2089](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2089),
    [@JSchoenbachler](https://github.com/JSchoenbachler)).

- New syntax highlighting themes a11y-light, a11y-dark,
  monochrome-light, monochrome-dark, and solarized

## pkgdown 2.0.3

CRAN release: 2022-04-24

- Fixes for R CMD check

## pkgdown 2.0.2

CRAN release: 2022-01-13

- New Korean (`ko`) translation thanks to
  [@mrchypark](https://github.com/mrchypark) and
  [@peremen](https://github.com/peremen)
  ([\#1944](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1944)). New Danish
  (`dk`) translation thanks to [@LDalby](https://github.com/LDalby).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now adjusts the heading levels of vignettes/articles that use `<h1>`
  as section headings to ensure that there’s one top-level heading
  ([\#2004](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2004)). This ensures
  that there’s one `<h1>`, the title, on each page, and makes the TOC in
  the sidebar work correctly.

- [`build_home_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer spuriously complains about missing images if you use plots
  in your `README.Rmd`
  ([\#1980](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1980),
  [\#1977](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1977)). It no longer
  tweaks the `src` path for `<img>` tags with absolute paths
  ([\#1955](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1955)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  once again works if `NEWS.md` uses `<h1>` headings
  ([\#1947](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1947)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now correctly interprets `title: internal`: it removes the section
  from the reference index *and* it doesn’t list the topics in that
  section as missing
  ([\#1958](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1958)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now gives a correct hint when the reference index YAML is not
  formatted correctly (e.g. empty item, or item such as “n” that needs
  to be escaped with quotes to not be interpreted as Boolean)
  ([\#1995](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1995)).

- [`deploy_to_branch()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_to_branch.md)
  gains a `subdir` argument, allowing you to deploy the site to a
  subdirectory ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#2001](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2001)).

- Front end changes:

  - The navbar gets a little more space after the version number, and
    aligns the baseline with rest of the navbar
    ([\#1989](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1989)).

  - Long lines in code output once again scroll, rather than being
    wrapped. While this is different to what you’ll see in the console,
    it’s a better fit for web pages where the available code width
    varies based on the browser width
    ([\#1940](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1940)).

  - scrollspy (which highlights the “active” heading in the sidebar) now
    computes the offset dynamically which makes it work better on sites
    with taller navbars
    ([\#1993](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1993)).

  - Fixed js issues that occurred on pages without a table of contents
    ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
    [\#1998](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1998)).

  - When htmlwidgets with jQuery or Bootstrap dependencies are used in
    examples or articles, pkgdown’s versions of jQuery and Boostrap will
    take precedence over the versions used by the htmlwidget
    ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
    [\#1997](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1997)).

- pkgdown no longer includes bundled author metadata for Hadley Wickham,
  RStudio, or the RConsortium, since there are now ways to include this
  meta data in template packages, and special casing these three
  entities feels increasingly weird
  ([\#1952](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1952)).

## pkgdown 2.0.1

CRAN release: 2021-12-03

- Fix CRAN failures.

- Reference sections are de-duplicated correctly
  ([\#1935](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1935)).

- Usage sections only generated for topics that have them; usage
  correctly displayed with BS3
  ([\#1931](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1931))

- Empty `\value{}` no longer errors
  ([\#1930](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1930)).

## pkgdown 2.0.0

CRAN release: 2021-11-30

### New authors

[@maelle](https://github.com/maelle) is now a pkgdown author in
recognition of her significant and sustained contributions. She was the
powerhouse behind many of the improvements in this release, particularly
the switch to bootstrap 5, improvements to customisation, and
implementation of local search.

### Bootstrap 5

- pkgdown can style your site with Bootstrap 5 (with help from
  [@jayhesselberth](https://github.com/jayhesselberth),
  [@apreshill](https://github.com/apreshill),
  [@cpsievert](https://github.com/cpsievert)). Opt-in by setting
  `boostrap` version in your `_pkgdown.yml`:

  ``` yaml
  template:
    bootstrap: 5
  ```

- We reviewed site accessibility and made a number of small
  improvements: ([\#782](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/782),
  [\#1553](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1553)):

  - Default font is larger and links are always underlined.
  - Heading anchors use `aria-hidden` to reduce noise for screenreader
    users.
  - Navbar dropdowns has improved `aria-labelledby`.
  - The default GitHub/GitLab links gain an `aria-label`; use for other
    icons is now supported, and encouraged in the docs.
  - Syntax highlighting uses a new more [accessible colour
    scheme](https://apreshill.github.io/rmda11y/arrow.html), designed by
    Alison Hill ([\#1536](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1536))
  - A skip link makes it easier to get directly to the page contents
    ([\#1827](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1827)).

- In-line footnotes mean you can read asides next to the text they refer
  to.

- Articles support tabsets, [as in R
  Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html).
  ([@JamesHWade](https://github.com/JamesHWade),
  [\#1667](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1667)).

- Other minor styling improvements:

  - The active item in TOC is indicated with background colour, rather
    than a border.
  - If present, the package logo is shown on all pages near the header.
  - Section anchors now appear on the right (making them usable on
    mobile phones)
    ([\#1782](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1782)).
  - The TOC is scrollable independently of the main content. This makes
    it more useful on long pages with many headings
    ([\#1610](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1610)).
  - The sidebar is shown at the bottom of the page on narrow screens.
  - Function arguments and the reference index
    ([\#1822](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1822)) use
    definition lists (`<dl>`) instead of tables. This gives more room
    for long argument names/lists of function and detailed descriptions,
    and displays better on mobile.
  - Links on the homepage no longer show the full url in the text.
  - The default navbar no longer includes a home icon - this took up
    precious horizontal space and wasn’t very useful since there was
    already a link to the home page immediately to its left
    ([\#1383](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1383)).

### Local search

- pkgdown now supports local searching (i.e. searching without an
  external service), and is enabled by default for Bootstrap 5 sites
  since no set-up is needed
  ([\#1629](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1629), with help
  from [@gustavdelius](https://github.com/gustavdelius) in
  [\#1655](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1655) and
  [@dieghernan](https://github.com/dieghernan) &
  [@GregorDeCillia](https://github.com/GregorDeCillia) in
  [\#1770](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1770)).

- pkgdown builds a more exhaustive `sitemap.xml` even for websites built
  with Bootstrap 3. This might change Algolia results if you use Algolia
  for search ([\#1629](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1629)).

### Customisation

- New
  [`vignette("customise")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/customise.md)
  documents all the ways you can customise your site, including the new
  options described below
  ([\#1573](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1573)).

- Sites can be easily themed with either bootswatch themes or by
  selectively overriding the `bslib` variables used to generate the CSS.
  pkgdown now uses scss for its own Bootstrap css tweaks, which means
  that you can customise more of the site from within `_pkgdown.yml`.

- You can pick from a variety of built-in syntax highlighting themes
  ([\#1823](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1823)). These
  control the colours (and background) of code in `<pre>` tags.

- pkgdown can now translate all the text that it generates
  ([\#1446](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1446)): this means
  that if you have a package where the docs are written in another
  language, you can match all the pkgdown UI to provide a seamless
  experience to non-English speakers. Activate the translations by
  setting the `lang` in `_pkgdown.yml`:

  ``` yaml
  lang: fr
  ```

  pkgdown includes translations for:

  - `es`, Spanish, thanks to
    [@edgararuiz-zz](https://github.com/edgararuiz-zz),
    [@dieghernan](https://github.com/dieghernan),
    [@rivaquiroga](https://github.com/rivaquiroga).
  - `de`, German, thanks to [@hfrick](https://github.com/hfrick).
  - `fr`, French, thanks to
    [@romainfrancois](https://github.com/romainfrancois),
    [@lionel-](https://github.com/lionel-),
    [@jplecavalier](https://github.com/jplecavalier), and
    [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle).
  - `pt`, Portuguese, thanks to
    [@rich-iannone](https://github.com/rich-iannone).
  - `tr`, Turkish, thanks to
    [@mine-cetinkaya-rundel](https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel).
  - `zh_CN`, simplified Chinese, thanks to
    [@yitao](https://github.com/yitao).

  If you’re interested in adding translations for your language please
  file an issue and we’ll help you get started.

- Template packages can now provide `inst/pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml` which is
  used as a set of defaults for `_pkgdown.yml`. It can be used to (e.g.)
  provide author definitions, select Bootstrap version and define bslib
  variables, and customise the sidebar, footer, navbar, etc.
  ([\#1499](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1499)).

- New `includes` parameters `in-header`, `before-body`, and `after-body`
  make it easy to add arbitrary HTML to every page. Their content will
  be placed at the end of the `<head>` tag, right below the opening
  `<body>` tag, and before the closing tag `</body>` respectively
  ([\#1487](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1487)). They match
  the bookdown options `in_header`, `before_body` and `after_body`.

  Additionally, you can use `before_title`, `before_navbar`, and
  `after_navbar` to add arbitrary HTML into the navbar/page header; they
  will appear to the left of the package name/version, and to the left
  and right of the navigation links respectively
  ([\#1882](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1882)).

- Authors configuration is more flexible
  ([\#1516](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1516)). You can now:

  - Choose the roles used for filtering authors for the sidebar and
    footer.
  - Choose the text before authors in the footer.
  - Add text before and after the authors list in the sidebar.
  - Add text before and after the authors list of the authors page.

- Sidebar specification is more flexible
  ([\#1443](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1443),
  [\#1488](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1488),
  [\#1502](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1502)). You can now:

  - Change the order of sidebar elements.
  - Add custom sidebar sections (with Markdown/HTML `text`).
  - Add a table of contents to the home page.
  - Completely suppress the sidebar.
  - Provide your own HTML for the navbar.

- Footer specification is more flexible
  ([\#1502](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1502)). You can now:

  - Change the placement of elements on the left and right.
  - Add text to the left and right (or even remove/replace default text)

- You can now exclude all default components from the navbar
  ([\#1517](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1517)).

- Expert users can now override layout templates provided by pkgdown or
  template packages by placing template files in `pkgdown/templates`
  ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#1897](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1897)).

### New features

- pkgdown now supports redirects
  ([\#1259](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1259),
  [@lorenzwalthert](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert)). The following
  yaml demonstrates the syntax, with old paths on the left and new
  paths/URLs on the right.

  ``` yaml
  redirects:
    - ["articles/old-vignette-name.html", "articles/new-vignette-name.html"]
    - ["articles/another-old-vignette-name.html", "articles/new-vignette-name.html"]
    - ["articles/yet-another-old-vignette-name.html", "https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev"]
  ```

- Use HTML classes `pkgdown-devel` or `pkgdown-release` to declare that
  certain content should appear only on the devel or release site. Use
  the class `pkgdown-hide` for content that should only appear only on
  GitHub/CRAN ([\#1299](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1299)).

- New
  [`pkgdown_sitrep()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/check_pkgdown.md)
  function reports whether the site is set up correctly; in particularly
  it currently reports if auto-linking will work
  ([\#1478](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1478)).

### Code

- Styling for errors, warnings, and messages has been tweaked. Messages
  are now displayed the same way as output, and warnings and errors are
  bolded, not coloured. This is part of a suite of changes that aim to
  give package authors greater control over the appearance of messages,
  warnings, and errors.

- Long lines in code output are now wrapped, rather than requiring
  scrolling. This better matches
  [`rmarkdown::html_document()`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/html_document.html)
  and what you see in the console.

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now allows linking to topics from other packages (either function
  names
  e.g. [`rlang::is_installed`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_installed.html)
  or topic names e.g.
  [`sass::font_face`](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/reference/font_face.html)).
  ([\#1664](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1664))

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  now runs examples with `options(rlang_interactive = FALSE)` (ensuring
  non-interactive behaviour in functions that use
  [`rlang::is_interactive()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_interactive.html)),
  `options(cli.dynamic = FALSE)`, `Sys.setenv(RSTUDIO = NA)` and
  `Sys.setLocale("LC_COLLATE", "C")`
  ([\#1693](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1693)). It also runs
  `pkgdown/pre-reference.R` before and `pkgdown/post-reference.R` after
  examples. These allow you to do any setup or teardown operations you
  might need ([\#1602](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1602)).

- A reference index section with `title: internal` is now silently
  dropped, allowing you to suppress warnings about topics that are not
  listed in the index
  ([\#1716](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1716)).

- Code blocks are now highlighted according to their declared language
  (e.g. `yaml`) if the documentation was built with roxygen2 7.1.2 or
  later ([\#1690](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1690),
  [\#1692](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1692)).

- New
  [`pkgdown_print()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/pkgdown_print.md)
  allows you to control how your objects are rendered in examples. It
  includes built-in handling for htmlwidgets and “browseable” HTML so
  pkgdown output now more closely resembles what you see in RStudio.
  Added extension points to make HTML widgets (and RGL in particular)
  work in rendered examples ([@dmurdoch](https://github.com/dmurdoch)).

- You can globally set the `width` of code output (in reference and
  articles) with

  ``` yaml
  code:
    width: 50
  ```

- Articles now render output styles created by cli/crayon
  ([\#1556](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1556)).

- When copy and pasting code blocks, lines containing output (e.g. `#>`)
  are automatically omitted
  ([\#1675](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1675)).

- Auto-linking improvements:

  - Links to inherited R6 methods now work correctly for both internal
    ([\#1173](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1173),
    [@vandenman](https://github.com/vandenman)) and external
    ([\#1476](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1476)) parent
    classes.

  - Linking no longer fails if a package contains duplicated Rd aliases.

  - Correctly link to reference pages when the `\name{}` entry doesn’t
    match the file name ([@dmurdoch](https://github.com/dmurdoch),
    [\#1586](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1586);
    [\#1676](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1676)).

### Articles

- Article subtitle, author and date (specified in the YAML frontmatter)
  are now correctly omitted from the article table of contents in the
  sidebar ([@maxheld83](https://github.com/maxheld83),
  [\#1428](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1428)).

- Support for `as_is: true` and non-default output formats for
  vignettes/ articles has been somewhat improved. Support is
  fundamentally limited due to the challenges of integrating HTML from
  output formats that pkgdown doesn’t know about, but it should be a
  little more reliable and a little better documented
  ([\#1757](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1757),
  [\#1764](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1764)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  no longer fails if you have a directory underneath vignettes with a
  `.Rmd` extension
  ([\#1425](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1425)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now correctly handles links to images in `man/figures` (which have the
  form `../man/figures`)
  ([\#1472](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1472)).

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  again sets the `theme` argument of the document format to `NULL` when
  `as_is: true` but lets users override this via the `theme` argument of
  the output format.

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  and
  [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now warn if you have images that won’t render on the website because
  they’re in unsupported directories
  ([\#1810](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1810)). Generally,
  it’s only safe to refer to figures in `man/figures` and `vignettes`.

- Articles stored in `vignettes/articles` are moved up one level so that
  they appear in `articles/` on the website. Previously, they would
  appear in `articles/articles`, so
  [`build_redirects()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_redirects.md)
  automatically adds redirects for any articles in the
  `vignettes/articles` directory
  ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie)
  [\#1911](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1911)).

### HTML, CSS and JS

- New `template` option `trailing_slash_redirect` that allows adding a
  script to redirect `your-package-url.com` to `your-package-url.com/`
  ([\#1439](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1439),
  [@cderv](https://github.com/cderv),
  [@apreshill](https://github.com/apreshill)).

- External links now get the class `external-link`. This makes them
  easier to style with CSS
  ([\#881](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/881),
  [\#1491](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1491)).

- Duplicated section ids are now de-duplicated; this makes pkgdown work
  better with the documentation of R6 classes.

- Updated CSS styles from pandoc to improve styling of reference lists
  ([\#1469](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1469)).

### Deployment

- [`build_site_github_pages()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site_github_pages.md)
  has been extracted out of
  [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  to make it easier to decouple building and deployment, and so we can
  take advantage of standard deployment actions
  ([\#1756](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1756)).

- [`deploy_to_branch()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_to_branch.md)
  now calls `git remote set-branches` with `--add` to avoid overwriting
  the existing `remote.{remote}.fetch` value
  ([@kyleam](https://github.com/kyleam),
  [\#1382](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1382)). It also now
  cleans out the website directory by default; revert to previous
  behaviour with `clean = FALSE`
  ([\#1394](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1394)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  will error if envar `CI` is `true` and there are missing topics
  ([@ThierryO](https://github.com/ThierryO),
  [\#1378](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1378)).

- You can override the `auto` development mode detected from the package
  version by setting env var `PKGDOWN_DEV_MODE` to `release` or `devel`.
  This is useful if your package uses a different convention to indicate
  development and release versions
  ([\#1081](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1081)).

### Other minor improvements and bug fixes

- `\special{}` tags with complex contents are rendered correctly
  ([@klmr](https://github.com/klmr),
  [\#1744](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1744)).

- `\arguments{}` and `\value{}` do a better job of handling mingled
  items and text
  ([\#1479](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1479)). The contents
  of `\value{}` are now shown immediately after `\arguments{}`.

- The default “branch” for linking to the file sources is `HEAD`, which
  will work regardless of whether your default branch is called “main”
  or “master”.

- Non-ORCID comments in `Authors@R` are now more usable: if such
  comments exist, the sidebar gains a link to the authors page, where
  they are displayed
  ([\#1516](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1516)).

- Citations with and without text versions are better handled, and text
  citations are correctly escaped for HTML
  ([@bastistician](https://github.com/bastistician),
  [\#1507](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1507)).

- README badges in a single paragraph placed between
  `<!-- badges: end -->`and `<!-- badges: end -->` comments are again
  detected ([\#1603](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1603)).

- The 404 page (default or from `.github/404.md`) is no longer built in
  the development mode (see
  [`?build_site`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md))
  as e.g. GitHub pages only uses the `404.html` in the site root
  ([\#1622](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1622)).

- All links on the 404 pages (navbar, scripts, CSS) are now absolute if
  there is an URL in the configuration file
  ([\#1622](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1622)).

- The version tooltip showed in the top navbar is now only set if you’ve
  explicitly set the `development.mode` in `_pkgdown.yml`
  ([\#1768](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1768)).

- All heading (e.g. headings on the reference index page, and the
  arguments heading on the reference pages) now get anchors
  ([\#1747](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1747)).

- Use `autolink_bare_uris` for Pandoc above version 2.0
  ([@marcosmolla](https://github.com/marcosmolla),
  [\#1618](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1618)).

- pkgdown now recognizes GitLab URLs to the source repository and adds
  the corresponding icon to the navbar
  ([\#1493](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1493)). It also
  supports [GitLab
  subgroups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/)
  ([@salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b),
  [\#1532](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1532)).

- Links for GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Enterprise repositories are
  detected by assuming such host address begin with `github.` or
  `gitlab.` ([@ijlyttle](https://github.com/ijlyttle),
  [\#1452](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1452)).

- The rules drawn by the CLI (as for example, in
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md))
  are protected against very narrow terminal windows
  ([@maxheld83](https://github.com/maxheld83),
  [\#1435](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1435)).

- Google Site Verification
  (<https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en>) can now
  be configured for pkgdown sites.

- `build_rmarkdown_format` sets `html_document(anchor_sections = FALSE)`
  to avoid needless dependencies ([@atusy](https://github.com/atusy),
  [\#1426](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1426)).

- Jira issues in NEWS can be automatically linked by setting your
  project name

  19. with `repo: jira_projects: [...]` and specifying a custom issue
      URL with `repo: url: issue: ...` in `_pkgdown.yml`
      ([@jonkeane](https://github.com/jonkeane),
      [\#1466](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1466)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  always creates citation information for the authors page, using
  metadata from `DESCRIPTION` when there is no `inst/CITATION` file, and
  links to this from the sidebar
  ([\#1904](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1904)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  no longer breaks with URLs containing numeric fragments
  ([@krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski),
  [\#1456](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1456)), recognises
  more styles of release heading
  ([\#1437](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1437)), and generate
  stable IDs using a the combination of the heading slug and package
  number. ([@Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo),
  [\#1015](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1015))

## pkgdown 1.6.1

CRAN release: 2020-09-12

- The article index (used for autolinking vignettes across packages)
  once again works
  ([\#1401](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1401)).

## pkgdown 1.6.0

CRAN release: 2020-09-07

### Major changes

- pkgdown now uses the new [downlit](https://downlit.r-lib.org/) package
  for all syntax highlighting and autolinking (in both reference topics
  and vignettes). There should be very little change in behaviour
  because the code in downlit was extracted from pkgdown, but this makes
  it easier to use pkgdown’s nice linking/highlighting in more places
  ([\#1234](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1234)).

- pkgdown now uses the
  [`ragg::agg_png()`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/reference/agg_png.html)
  device to generate example figures. This should be a little faster and
  produce higher quality output. Learn more at <https://ragg.r-lib.org>
  ([\#1320](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1320)).

### Minor improvements and bug fixes

#### Rd translation

- `\special{}` support inside `\usage{}` added to allow non-standard R
  usage syntax ([@klmr](https://github.com/klmr),
  [\#1345](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1345)).

- `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` are now supported; the “current” OS is hard
  coded to “unix” to ensure reproducible output regardless of where you
  build the website
  ([\#1384](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1384)).

- Nested `\subsection{}`s now generate appropriate heading levels (h3,
  h4, h5 etc) ([\#1377](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1377)),
  and get anchor links
  ([\#1389](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1389)).

- `\preformatted{}` no longer double escapes its contents
  ([\#1311](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1311)).

#### Articles and vignettes

- [`build_articles()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  no longer sets the `theme` argument of the document format to `NULL`
  when `as_is: true`. This should allow it to work with a wider range of
  output formats including `bookdown::html_vignette2()` and friends
  ([@GegznaV](https://github.com/GegznaV),
  [\#955](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/955),
  [\#1352](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1352)).

- When
  [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  fails, it gives the complete failure message
  ([\#1379](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1379)).

- Markdown header attributes are now processed in all markdown files
  ([@jonkeane](https://github.com/jonkeane),
  [\#1343](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1343))

#### Auto-linking and syntax highlighting

- The branch used for source linking can be configured by setting
  `repo: branch: branch_name` in `_pkgdown.yml`
  ([@jonkeane](https://github.com/jonkeane),
  [\#1355](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1355)):

  ``` yaml
  repo:
    branch: main
  ```

- `autolink_html()` is (soft) deprecated. Please use
  [`downlit::downlit_html_path()`](https://downlit.r-lib.org/reference/downlit_html_path.html)
  instead.

- Highlighting of empty expressions works once more
  ([\#1310](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1310)).

- New `deploy$install_metadata` option in `_pkgdown.yml`. Setting it to
  `true` will store site metadata in the package itself, allowing
  offline access for packages that to autolink to the package’s website
  ([@mstr3336](https://github.com/mstr3336),
  [\#1336](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1336)).

#### Other

- You can now control the background colour of plots with the
  `figures.bg` option (it is transparent by default, and given a white
  background by css). See
  [`?build_reference`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  for an example.

- HTML is automatically stripped from the page title
  ([\#1318](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1318)).

- Suppressing CRAN dates in news file now actually works.

- All HTTP requests are now retried upon failure
  ([@jameslamb](https://github.com/jameslamb),
  [\#1305](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1305)).

- Setting `clean = TRUE` in
  [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  removes old files from the deployed site before building a new one
  ([\#1297](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1297)).

## pkgdown 1.5.1

CRAN release: 2020-04-09

- Syntax highlighting works on Windows once more
  ([\#1282](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1282)).

- pkgdown no longer fails if your `.Rd` files have duplicated `\aliases`
  as were produced by an older version of roxygen2
  ([\#1290](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1290)).

- Rendering empty `.md` file now returns empty string
  ([\#1285](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1285)).

- [`build_articles_index()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  is now exported to rapidly rebuild the index
  ([\#1281](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1281))

- [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  now accepts a `host` argument to specify alternate hosts (e.g., Github
  enterprise) ([@dimagor](https://github.com/dimagor),
  [\#1165](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1165)) and once again
  works as intended on Travis-CI
  ([@jimhester](https://github.com/jimhester),
  [\#1276](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1276)).

## pkgdown 1.5.0

CRAN release: 2020-03-25

### New features

- The articles index page and navbar have been overhauled. There are two
  major new features in this release:

  - The articles index page now displays article `description`s, taken
    from YAML metadata belonging to each article. This lets you provide
    more context about each article and describe why one might want to
    read it ([\#1227](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1227)).

  - The articles navbar is now also controlled by the `articles` section
    in `_pkgdown.yml`. The ordering of the sections, and articles within
    them, control the order of the articles in the navbar, and you can
    use the new `navbar` field to control whether or not each section
    appears in the navbar
    ([\#1101](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1101),
    [\#1146](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1146)).

- The reference index now has two levels of heading hierarchy: `title`
  and `subtitle` ([\#327](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/327)).

- Tables of contents in sidebars now use
  [bootstrap-toc](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/); this
  considerably improves navigation for long articles and reference
  pages.

- You can now control the links to source files (in reference pages and
  articles) and issues and users (in the NEWS) with new `repo$url`
  config option
  ([\#1238](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1238)). This makes
  it easier to use pkgdown with GitHub enterprise, packages in
  subdirectories, and other source hosts (like bitbucket).

  ``` yaml
  repo:
    url:

      user: https://github.com/
  ```

  The individual components (e.g. path, issue number, username) are
  pasted on the end of these urls so they should have trailing `/`s.

  You don’t need to set these links for GitLab, as pkgdown now detects
  GitLab urls automatically (since they use the same structure as
  GitHub) ([\#1045](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1045)).

- There’s much richer control over Open Graph and Twitter metadata for
  the whole site and for individual articles. See new
  [`vignette("metadata")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/metadata.md)
  for details ([@gadenbuie](https://github.com/gadenbuie),
  [\#936](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/936)).

- New
  [`deploy_to_branch()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_to_branch.md)
  function to build and deploy a site to a branch, defaulting to
  `gh-pages` for use with GitHub Pages. This is used in our recommended
  GitHub action workflow for automatically building and deploying
  pkgdown sites for packages on GitHub
  ([@jimhester](https://github.com/jimhester),
  [\#1221](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1221)).

- Updated JS libraries: jquery 3.3.1 -\> 3.4.1; bootswatch 3.3.7 -\>
  3.4.0; bootstrap 3.3.7 -\> bootstrap 3.4.1; docsearch 2.6.1 -\> 2.6.3;
  fontawesome 5.11.1 -\> 5.12.1; headroom.js 0.9.44 -\> 0.11.0;
  clipboard.js 2.0.4 -\> 2.0.6
  ([@jayhesselberth](https://github.com/jayhesselberth)).

### Auto-linking improvements

- Examples and Rmd now use exactly the same syntax highlighting
  strategy.

- In examples and Rmd, calls of the form `current_package::foo` now get
  a local link ([\#1262](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1262)).

- `\preformatted{}` blocks are now highlighted and linked if they parse
  as R code ([\#1180](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1180)).

- [`library(pkgdown)`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is now automatically
  linked to the reference index for “pkgdown” not the documentation for
  [`library()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)
  ([\#1161](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1161)).

- `help("topic")` is now automatically linked to the documentation for
  “topic”, not to the documentation for
  [`help()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/help.html)
  ([\#1210](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1210))

### Minor improvements and bug fixes

#### Articles

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer uses (unrendered) `README.Rmd` or `index.Rmd` if
  corresponding `.md` files are not found.

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  failures now print more information to help you debug the problem
  ([\#952](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/952)).

- The name of the vignette mapped to the “Get started” entry in the
  navbar is now more flexible. You can use an article (e.g
  `articles/{pkgname}`) and if your package has a `.` in its name you
  can replace it with `-` to generate a valid article name (e.g. the get
  started vignette for `pack.down` would be `pack-down`)
  ([\#1166](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1166)).

#### Deployment

- [`deploy_to_branch()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_to_branch.md)
  now correctly captures the commit SHA on GitHub Actions
  ([@coatless](https://github.com/coatless),
  [\#1252](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1252)).

- `deploy_to_branch(github_pages = TRUE)` generates a `.nojekyll` to
  prevent jekyll ever executing
  ([\#1242](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1242)).

- `CNAME` is no longer generated by
  [`init_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/init_site.md),
  but is instead conditionally by
  [`deploy_to_branch()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_to_branch.md)
  when `github_pages = TRUE`. This is a better a fit because the `CNAME`
  file is only needed by GitHub pages
  ([\#969](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/969)).

- [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  argument `repo_slug` has been deprecated and is no longer needed or
  used. ([@jimhester](https://github.com/jimhester),
  [\#1221](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1221))

#### News

See additional details in
[`?build_news`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md):

- You can optionally suppress the CRAN release dates added to the news
  page ([\#1118](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1118)).

- Multi-page news style gets a better yaml specification (the old style
  will continue to work so no need to change existing YAML).

#### Reference

- A topic named `index` will not longer clobber the reference index
  ([\#1110](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1110)).

- Topic names/aliases on reference index are now escaped
  ([\#1216](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1216)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  gives better warnings if your `_pkgdown.yml` is constructed
  incorrectly ([\#1025](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1025)).

- New `has_keyword()` topic selector for `reference`.
  `has_keyword("datasets")` is particularly useful for selecting all
  data documentation
  ([\#760](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/760)).

- New `lacks_concepts()` can select topics that do not contain any of a
  number of specified concepts. ([@mikldk](https://github.com/mikldk),
  [\#1232](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1232))

#### Home, authors, and citation

- pkgdown now escapes html and linkifies links in comments in author
  info from DESCRIPTION ([@maelle](https://github.com/maelle),
  [\#1204](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1204))

- pkgdown now uses the ORCiD logo included in Font Awesome 5.11 instead
  of querying it from members.orcid.org
  ([@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo),
  [\#1153](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1153))

- badges are now extracted from everything between
  `<!--badges: start-->` and `<!--badges: end-->`. They used to be
  extracted only if they were direct children of the first `<p>` after
  `<!--badges: start-->`.

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now looks for `pkgdown/index.md` in addition to the top-level `index`
  or `README` files ([@nteetor](https://github.com/nteetor),
  [\#1031](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1031))

#### Navbar

- pkgdown now formats the package version displayed in the navbar the
  same way as it has been specified in the DESCRIPTION file. In
  particular, version separators (e.g. `.` and `-`) are preserved.
  ([\#1170](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1170),
  [@kevinushey](https://github.com/kevinushey))

- add support for navbar submenus: you can create submenus following the
  convention established in
  [rstudio/rmarkdown#721](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/721)
  ([@ijlyttle](https://github.com/ijlyttle),
  [@wendtke](https://github.com/wendtke),
  [\#1213](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1213))

#### Other

- Updated JS libraries: jquery 3.3.1 -\> 3.4.1; bootswatch 3.3.7 -\>
  3.4.0; bootstrap 3.3.7 -\> bootstrap 3.4.1; docsearch 2.6.1 -\> 2.6.3
  ([@jayhesselberth](https://github.com/jayhesselberth)).

- Markdown conversion now explicitly allows markdown inside of HTML
  blocks; this was previously accidentally disabled
  ([\#1220](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1220)).

- A timestamp for the last site build is reported in `pkgdown.yml`
  ([\#1122](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1122)).

## pkgdown 1.4.1

CRAN release: 2019-09-14

- Don’t install test package in user library (fixes CRAN failure).

## pkgdown 1.4.0

CRAN release: 2019-09-03

### New features

- build citation as specified by the `textVersion` argument of
  `citEntry` in the `CITATION` file
  ([\#1096](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1096),
  [@yiluheihei](https://github.com/yiluheihei))

- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md),
  [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  and
  [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  gain a parameter `devel` which controls whether you’re in deployment
  or development mode. It generalises and replaces (with deprecation)
  the existing `document` argument.

  Development mode is optimised for rapid iteration and is the default
  for
  [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md).
  It uses
  [`pkgload::load_all()`](https://pkgload.r-lib.org/reference/load_all.html)
  to load code directly from disk in order.

  Deployment mode is slower, but guarantees correct results, and is the
  default for
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md).
  It installs the package into a temporary library, and runs
  examples/articles in a new process.

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  no longer runs `devtools::document()`
  ([\#1079](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1079)) and
  [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  no longer re-builds `README.Rmd` or `index.Rmd`. This makes the scope
  of responsibility of pkgdown more clear: it now only creates/modifies
  files in `doc/`.

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now strips quotes from `Title` and `Description` fields when
  generating page metadata. Additionally, you can now override the
  defaults via the `title` and `description` fields in the `home`
  section of `_pkgdown.yml`
  ([\#957](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/957),
  [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle)).

- [`vignette("linking")`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/articles/linking.md)
  describes how pkgdown’s automatic linking works, and how to ensure
  that cross-package links point to the right place.

### Bug fixes and minor improvements

#### Rd translation

- `\examples{}` rendering has been completely overhauled so it now first
  converts the entire mixed Rd-R block to R prior, and then evaluates
  the whole thing. This considerably improves the fidelity of the
  translation at a small cost of no longer being able to remove
  `\donttest{}` and friends
  ([\#1087](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1087)).

- `\item{}`s in `\describe{}` containing whitespace are translated
  correctly ([\#1117](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1117)).

- `\dots` and `\ldots` are translated to `...` instead of the ellipsis,
  since they’re often found in code
  ([\#1114](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1114)).

- `\tabular{}` translation handles code better
  ([@mitchelloharawild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild),
  [\#978](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/978)).

- `\subsection{}` contents are now treated as paragraphs, not inline
  text ([\#991](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/991)).

- `\preformatted{}` blocks preserve important whitespace
  ([\#951](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/951)).

#### Front end

- Links to online documentation for functions in code chunks are no
  longer displayed when printing
  ([\#1135](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1135),
  [@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo)).

- Updated fontawesome to v5.7.1. fontawesome 5 [deprecated the `fa`
  prefix](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/upgrading-from-version-4#changes).
  If you have used custom icons in your navbar, you’ll should update
  them from (e.g.) `fa fa-home` to `fas fa-home`. Brands now have a
  separate prefix so `fa fa-github` becomes `fab fa-github`
  ([\#953](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/953)).

- The navbar is now automatically hidden with
  [headroom.js](https://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/).

- The sticky behaviour of the navbar is now implemented in pure CSS
  instead of relying a the 3rd party javascript library
  ([\#1016](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1016),
  [@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo))

- Favicons are now automatically built from a package logo
  ([\#949](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/949)).

#### Linking

- Infix operators (e.g., `%in%` and `%*%`) are now linked to their
  documentation
  ([\#1082](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1082)).

- Function names can now be included in headers without spurious
  auto-linking ([\#948](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/948)).

- Links to external documentation now point to
  [rdrr.io](https://rdrr.io)
  ([\#998](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/998)).

#### Other

- News page recognises more version specifications (including the
  “(development version)” now used by usethis)
  ([\#980](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/980)).

- Subdirectories are supported for assets
  ([\#939](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/939),
  [@ijlyttle](https://github.com/ijlyttle)).

- A default 404 page (`404.html`) is built, unless a custom
  `.github/404.md` is provided
  ([\#947](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/947)).

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  now uses the raw vignette title as page `<title>` and `og:title`
  ([@maelle](https://github.com/maelle),
  [\#1037](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1037)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  now looks for license files spelled either as LICENSE or LICENCE
  ([\#972](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/972)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  can find badges in paragraph coming after the comment
  `<!-- badges: start -->`
  ([\#670](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/670),
  [@gaborcsardi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi),
  [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md)
  will add a community section to the sidebar if there is either a code
  of conduct (`.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) or a contributing guide
  (`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`)
  ([\#1044](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1044),
  [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle)).

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  gains a `topics` argument which allows you to re-build only specified
  topics.

- `build_site(new_process = TRUE)` gains a timeout,
  `options(pkgdown.timeout = 10)`, that can be used to prevent stalled
  builds.

- `deploy_site_github(install = FALSE)` makes it possible to opt out of
  installation.

- `dev_mode()` now recognises `0.1.9000` as a development version of a
  package (this is an emerging standard we use for packages with
  backward incompatible changes)
  ([\#1101](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1101)).

## pkgdown 1.3.0

CRAN release: 2018-12-06

- Restore accidentally deleted `build_logo()` function so that logos are
  once more copied to the website.

- Fix to `pkgdown.css` so page header has correct amount of top margin.

- `content-home.html` template is no longer used when the homepage is an
  `.Rmd` (Reverts [\#834](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/834).
  Fixes [\#927](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/927),
  [\#929](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/929))

- [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  now passes parameters to
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  ([@noamross](https://github.com/noamross),
  [\#922](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/922)), and the
  documentation gives slightly better advice.

- Correct off-by-one error in navbar highlighting javascript; now no
  navbar is highlighted if none match the current path
  ([\#911](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/911)).

- Tweaking of HTML table classes was fixed
  ([@yonicd](https://github.com/yonicd),
  [\#912](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/912))

- Restore accidentally removed `docsearch.css` file.

## pkgdown 1.2.0

CRAN release: 2018-11-20

### New features

- [`deploy_site_github()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/deploy_site_github.md)
  can be used from continuous integration systems (like travis) to
  automatically deploy your package website to GitHub Pages. See
  documentation for how to set up details
  ([@jimhester](https://github.com/jimhester)).

- `build_favicon()` creates high resolution favicons from the package
  logo, and saves them in `pkgdown/`. They are created using the
  <https://realfavicongenerator.net/> API, and are better suited for
  modern web usage (e.g. retina display screens, desktop shortcuts,
  etc.). This also removes the dependency on the magick package, making
  automated deployment a little easier
  ([@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo),
  [\#883](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/883)).

- Users with limited internet connectivity can explicitly disable
  internet usage by pkgdown by setting
  `options(pkgdown.internet = FALSE)`
  ([\#774](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/774),
  [\#877](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/877)).

### Improvements to Rd translation

- [`rd2html()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/rd2html.md) is
  now exported to facilitate creation of translation reprexes.

- `\Sexpr{}` conversion supports multiple arguments, eliminating
  `x must be a string or a R connection` errors when using `\doi{}`
  ([\#738](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/738)).

- `\tabular{}` conversion better handles empty cells
  ([\#780](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/780)).

- `\usage{}` now supports qualified functions eliminating
  `Error in fun_info(x) : Unknown call: ::` errors
  ([\#795](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/795)).

- Invalid tags now generate more informative errors
  ([@BarkleyBG](https://github.com/BarkleyBG),
  [\#771](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/771),
  [\#891](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/891))

### Front end

- The default footer now displays the version of pkgdown used to build
  the site ([\#876](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/876)).

- All third party resources are now fetched from a single CDN and are
  give a SRI hash ([@bisaloo](https://github.com/bisaloo),
  [\#893](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/893)).

- The navbar version now has class “version” so you can more easily
  control its display
  ([\#680](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/680)).

- The default css has been tweaked to ensure that icons are visible on
  all browsers ([\#852](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/852)).

### Bug fixes and minor improvements

#### Home page

- Can now build sites for older packages that don’t have a `Authors@R`
  field ([\#727](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/727)).

- Remote urls ending in `.md` are no longer tweaked to end in `.html`
  ([\#763](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/763)).

- Bug report link is only shown if there’s a “BugReports” field
  ([\#855](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/855)).

- `content-home.html` template is now used when the homepage is an
  `.Rmd` ([@goldingn](https://github.com/goldingn),
  [\#787](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/787)).

- A link to the source `inst/CITATION` was added to the authors page
  ([\#714](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/714)).

#### News

- Uses stricter regular expression when linking to GitHub authors
  ([\#902](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/902)).

#### Reference

- Unexported functions and test helpers are no longer loaded
  ([\#789](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/789)).

- Selectors that do not match topics now generate a warning. If none of
  the specified selectors have a match, no topics are selected
  ([\#728](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/728)).

#### Articles

- The display depth of vignette tables of contents can be configured by
  setting `toc: depth` in `_pkgdown.yml`
  ([\#821](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/821)):

  ``` yaml
  toc:
    depth: 2
  ```

#### Overall site

- [`init_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/init_site.md)
  now creates a CNAME file if one doesn’t already exist and the site’s
  metadata includes a `url` field.

- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  loses vestigal `mathjax` parameter. This didn’t appear to do anything
  and no one could remember why it existed
  ([\#785](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/785)).

- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  now uses colours even if `new_process = TRUE`
  ([@jimhester](https://github.com/jimhester)).

## pkgdown 1.1.0

CRAN release: 2018-06-02

### New features

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md)
  and
  [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  get new `document` argument. When `TRUE`, the default, will
  automatically run `devtools::document()` to ensure that your
  documentation is up to date.

- [`build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_site.md)
  gains a `new_process` argument, which defaults to `TRUE`. This will
  run pkgdown in a separate process, and is recommended practice because
  it improves reproducibility
  ([\#647](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/647)).

- Improved display for icons: icons must be 30px and stored in top-level
  `icons/` directory. They are embedded in a separate column of
  reference index table, instead of being inside a comment (!)
  ([\#607](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/607)).

### Front end

- Added a keyboard shortcut for searching. Press `shift` + `/` (`?`) to
  move focus to the search bar
  ([\#642](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/642)).

- The Algolia logo is correctly shown in the search results
  ([\#673](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/673)).

- Navbar active tab highlighting uses a superior approach (suggested by

  1.  which should mean that the active page is correctly highlighted in
      all scenarios
      ([\#660](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/660)).

- `pkgdown.js` is better isolated so it should still work even if you
  load html widgets that import a different version of jquery
  ([\#655](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/655)).

### Improvements to Rd translation

- [`vignette()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/vignette.html) calls that don’t
  link to existing vignettes silently fail to link instead of generating
  an uninformative error messages
  ([\#652](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/652)). Automatic
  linking works for re-exported objects that are not functions
  ([@gaborcsardi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi),
  [\#666](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/666)).

- Empty `\section{}`s are ignored
  ([\#656](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/656)). Previously,
  empty sections caused error `Error in rep(TRUE, length(x) - 1)`.

- `\Sexpr{}` supports `results=text`, `results=Rd` and `results=hide`
  ([\#651](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/651)).

- `\tabular{}` no longer requires a terminal `\cr`
  ([\#664](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/664),
  [\#645](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/645)).

### Minor bug fixes and improvements

- Add `inst/pkgdown.yml` as a possible site configuration file so that
  packages on CRAN can be built without needing the development version
  ([\#662](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/662)).

- Default navbar template now uses site title, not package name (the
  package name is the default title, so this will not affect most sites)
  ([\#654](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/654)).

- You can suppress indexing by search engines by setting `noindex: true`
  `pkgdown.yml` ([\#686](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/686))

  ``` yaml
  template:
    params:
      noindex: true
  ```

- [`build_article()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_articles.md)
  sets `IN_PKGDOWN` env var so
  [`in_pkgdown()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/in_pkgdown.md)
  works ([\#650](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/650)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md):
  CITATION files with non-UTF-8 encodings (latin1) work correctly,
  instead of generating an error. For non-UTF-8 locales, ensure you have
  e.g. `Encoding: latin1` in your `DESCRIPTION`; but best practice is to
  re-enode your CITATION file to UTF-8
  ([\#689](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/689)).

- [`build_home()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_home.md):
  Markdown files (e.g., `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) stored in `.github/` are
  copied and linked correctly
  ([\#682](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/682)).

- [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md):
  Multi-page changelogs (generated from `NEWS.md` with
  `news: one_page: false` in `_pkgdown.yml`) are rendered correctly.

- [`build_reference()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_reference.md):
  reference index shows infix functions (like `%+%`) as `` `%+%` ``, not
  `` `%+%`() `` on
  ([\#659](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/659)).

## pkgdown 1.0.0

CRAN release: 2018-05-03

- Major refactoring of path handling. `build_` functions no longer take
  `path` or `depth` arguments. Instead, set the `destination` directory
  at the top level of `pkgdown.yml`.

- Similarly,
  [`build_news()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/reference/build_news.md)
  no longer takes a `one_page` argument; this should now be specified in
  the `_pkgdown.yml` instead. See the documentation for an example.
