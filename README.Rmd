pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package. You can see pkgdown in action at <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org>: this is the output of pkgdown applied to the latest version of pkgdown. Learn more in `vignette("pkgdown")` or `?build_site`.

## Installation

::: .pkgdown-release
```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("pkgdown")
```
:::

::: .pkgdown-devel
```{r}
#| eval: false
# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-lib/pkgdown")
```
:::

## Usage

Get started with [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/):

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Run once to configure your package to use and deploy pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Preview your site locally before publishing
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This adds the necessary components and sets up GitHub Actions[^1] for automatic site building when deploying.
Your `README.md` becomes the homepage, documentation in `man/` generates a function reference, and vignettes will be rendered into `articles/`.

[^1]: If you don't use GitHub, you can use `usethis::use_pkgdown()` + `pkgdown::build_site()` to create a website.

### pkgdown 2.0.0 and Bootstrap 5

pkgdown 2.0.0 includes an upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 5, which is accompanied by a whole bunch of minor UI improvements. If you've heavily customised your site, there's a small chance that this will break your site, so everyone needs to explicitly opt-in to the upgrade by adding the following to `_pkgdown.yml`:

```yaml
template:
  bootstrap: 5
```

Then learn about the many new ways to customise your site in `vignette("customise")`.

## In the wild

At last count, pkgdown is used [by over 12,000 packages](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A_pkgdown.yml+language%3AYAML&type=code&l=YAML). Here are a few examples:

* [bayesplot](http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/index.html)
  ([source](https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/tree/gh-pages)):
  plotting functions for posterior analysis, model checking, and MCMC
  diagnostics.

* [valr](https://rnabioco.github.io/valr/)
  ([source](https://github.com/rnabioco/valr)):
  read and manipulate genome intervals and signals.

* [mkin](https://pkgdown.jrwb.de/mkin/)
  ([source](https://github.com/jranke/mkin)):
  calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report

* [NMF](http://renozao.github.io/NMF/master/index.html)
  ([source](https://github.com/renozao/NMF)):
  a framework to perform non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

* [tidyverse and r-lib packages source](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A%22_pkgdown.yml%22+AND+%28org%3Atidyverse+OR+org%3Ar-lib%29&type=code)

Comparing the source and output of these sites is a great way to learn new pkgdown techniques.
