exist will look next in \code{pkg/inst/staticdocs/templates}, then
in staticdocs itself.}

\item{assets_path}{Path in which to look for assets files. If
this doesn't exist, will use \code{pkg/inst/staticdocs/assets},

\description{
Currently, \code{build_site} builds documentation for help topics,
vignettes, demos, and a \code{README.md}, if present.
}
\section{Home page}{


The home page is generated from \code{inst/staticdocs/README.md},
\code{README.md}, or the \code{DESCRIPTION} if neither readme file is
present. On the homepage, you should show how to install the package,
describe what it does, and provide an example of how to use it.
